summary: Dirk is an experiment in creating a malware scanning daemon

Still in the PoC phase (which it honestly may never exit), Dirk is an interface to the Yara scanning engine that is
meant to be run in an isolated environment away from the files being scanned. This allows you to scan untrusted files
without the worry of local security vulnerabilities being exploited by bad actors (think 0day exploits in common tools
such as `file`, `grep`, or even Yara itself). It also supports more advanced features such as dynamic analysis of PHP
code via ephemeral podman-based containers that utilize PHP's Xdebug module, which can help greatly when dealing with
heavily obfuscated code.
